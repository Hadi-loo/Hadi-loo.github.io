Hi! I am Hadi Babalou, a senior bachelor student in Computer Engineering at the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). Through my coursework, research experiences, and personal projects, I have developed a strong interest in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Recently, my curiosity has deepened in the area of Trustworthy AI, particularly in topics such as robustness, interpretability, and fairness of machine learning models, with a specific focus on large language models, medical applications, and astrophysical applications. My goal is to expand my knowledge in these areas and contribute to advancing the field, working under the guidance of leading experts in the community.
